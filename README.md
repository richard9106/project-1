## Issues found during site development

* #### menu style is not efficient and does not look good

![testing_issue_1](./assets/images/test/error-menu.jpg)

I used  a display block to put the menu items closer together and then change the display position from full screen to just a section below the menu bar, also I changed the colors to make look better

![testing_issue_1_fixed](./assets/images/test/nuevo%20menu.jpg)

* ### one of the boxes in support page escapes from the screen in mobile version.

![testing_issue_2](./assets/images/test/support-error.jpg)

To fix this bug in the mobile version I have changed the width:400px to 90% in the media query 480px.

![testing_issue_2_fixed](./assets/images/test/support-fixed.jpg)

* The holderplace text in contact form is to small and it's hard to read.

![testing_issue_3](./assets/images/test/form-error.jpg)


To fix this bug I commented in the Normalize.css document the line 164 that had a font-zise: 100% and font-family: inherit and in the style.css file I 
and I gave him a width:95% in a mobile version.

## Performance testing

I run [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tool to check performance of the website.
I had to do couple of changes to improve performance. Screenshots are presented below:

![bug_performance1](./assets/images/test/preformance-test-1.jpg)
![bug_performance2](./assets/images/test/preformance-test-2.jpg)

Final results:
![performance_final](./assets/images/test/preformance-fixeed.jpg)
I noticed that this tests scores vary from time to time and depends on external libraries as well. 



## Code Validation
 At the and of the project I used two websites to validate a code
 
 * [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS
 * [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/) to test HTML
