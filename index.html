        <h3>You will be a great father</h3>
        <p>
          Your baby is going to be a change in your life and many fears arise.
          It is perfectly normal. "Will I make mistakes?" Will I be able to do
          it right?" The answer is yes. You will be capable, you will learn and
          your baby will be perfectly under your care. You just need patience
          and organization.

        <h3>Get informed, without obsessions</h3>
        <p>
          Try to inform yourself as much as possible without obsessing. There
          are millions of books, advice for new parents, prenatal classes... Do
          not fall into the trap of information overload.

        <p>
          Experience is a degree, without a doubt. Other parents may recommend
          tips or ways to make homework easier. The risk is that they end up
          overwhelming you. Don't worry, new father, you will end up having your
          own method and you will be the one to advise other parents.

        <h3>Am I holding you right?</h3>
        <p>
          Holding your baby in your arms is a wonderful feeling but at first it
          can be a little scary. As a new parent you will wonder if you are
          holding him correctly. There are several ways to do it:
          <ul>
            <li>Leaning on your forearm face down.</li>
            <li>Leaning on your forearm face up.</li>
            <li> On your chest, vertically and holding his head.</li>
            <li>Avoid moving him too much even if it is playing to make him laugh.</li>
          </ul>
